Problem Set 1
For this problem set, you’ll use CS50 Lab, a cloud-based programming environment with interactive instructions built atop CS50 Sandbox. Start each problem (linked below) by watching the introduction video (if there is one) and then follow the instructions step by step, pressing the green next button as you move through the Lab. When you reach the end, the last step will be submitting your code.

What to Do
Submit Hello
Submit one of:
this version of Mario if feeling less comfortable
this version of Mario if feeling more comfortable
Submit one of:
Cash if feeling less comfortable
Credit if feeling more comfortable
If you submit both Marios, we’ll record the higher of your two scores. If you submit both of Cash and Credit, we’ll record the higher of your two scores.

Advice
Try out any of David’s programs from class via Week 1’s sandbox.
If you see any errors when compiling your code with make, focus first on fixing the very first error you see, scrolling up as needed. If unsure what it means, try asking help50 for help. For instance, if trying to compile hello, and
make hello
is yielding errors, try running

help50 make hello
instead!

Remember that your code will be graded for both correctness and style. You should test your program with various inputs for correctness. You should style your code per the CS50 Style Guide.
